# Unsafe-Activity-Classification

**Problem Statement**: It is often difficult for security personnel to identify suspicious behavior in public areas. Currently, security personas are trained to spot micro expressions and weapons by scanning crowds of people. This is expensive, prone to human error, not scalable with large numbers of people. 

## Approach 
Create a neural network using TensorFlow to identify objects that may be harmful/illegal in crowded areas to assist security personnel in identifying suspicious behavior.
